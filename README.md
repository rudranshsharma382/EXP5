Student Details

Name: Rudransh Sharma

PRN: 25070123096

Experiment No.: 5

Aim

The aim of this experiment is to study the Dictionary data type in Python and understand its creation, properties, and operations such as accessing values, updating elements, deleting key-value pairs, searching data, and applying dictionaries to real-life problems like student records, product management, and login validation.

Theory

A dictionary in Python is a collection of data stored in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are written using curly braces {} with keys and values separated by a colon :. Each key in a dictionary must be unique, while values can be of any data type.

Key Characteristics of Dictionary

Stores data in key-value format

Keys must be unique and immutable

Values can be of any data type

Mutable (values can be changed)

Does not support indexing

Algorithms
Algorithm 1: Creation and Display of Dictionary

Create a dictionary with keys such as Brand, Model, and Year.

Print the dictionary.

Algorithm 2: Accessing Values Using Keys

Create a dictionary with car details.

Access the value using its key.

Display the value.

Algorithm 3: Duplicate Keys Handling in Dictionary

Create a dictionary with duplicate keys.

Assign different values to the same key.

Print the dictionary.

Observe that the latest value overwrites the previous one.

Algorithm 4: Finding Length and Type of Dictionary

Create a dictionary.

Use len() to count key-value pairs.

Use type() to check the data type.

Algorithm 5: Adding and Updating Dictionary Elements

Create a dictionary with car details.

Use update() method to add a new key-value pair.

Display updated dictionary.

Use values() method to retrieve all values.

Algorithm 6: Retrieving and Removing Dictionary Elements

Create a dictionary storing student information.

Retrieve a value using a key.

Remove a key-value pair using pop().

Print the updated dictionary.

Algorithm 7: Updating Product Prices

Create a dictionary storing product names and prices.

Display original dictionary.

Update the price of a product.

Display updated dictionary.

Algorithm 8: Searching Student Marks

Create a dictionary storing student names and marks.

Take student name as input.

Check if the name exists in dictionary.

Display marks if found, else display error message.

Algorithm 9: User Login Validation

Create a dictionary storing usernames and passwords.

Accept username and password from user.

Check if username exists in dictionary.

Display login success or failure message.

Algorithm 10: Finding Highest Marks

Create a dictionary of students and their marks.

Use max() function with get() method.

Display the student with highest marks.

Definition of Commands Used

dict: Built-in data type used to store key-value pairs.

len(): Returns the number of key-value pairs.

type(): Returns the data type of the variable.

update(): Adds or updates key-value pairs in a dictionary.

values(): Returns all values from the dictionary.

pop(): Removes a specified key and returns its value.

in: Checks if a key exists in dictionary.

max(): Returns key with maximum value using get().

get(): Retrieves value of specified key.

input(): Takes input from user.

print(): Displays output.

Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully studied the Dictionary data type in Python and its operations. We learned how to create dictionaries, access and modify values, remove elements, search records, and apply dictionaries to real-world problems such as student databases, product management, and login systems. Dictionaries provide an efficient and organized way to store and manage data using key-value pairs.
