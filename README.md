Experiment No.: 5

AIM

The aim of this experiment is to study the Dictionary data type in Python and understand its creation, properties, and operations such as accessing values, updating elements, deleting key-value pairs, searching data, and applying dictionaries to real-life problems like student records, product management, and login validation.

THEORY

1.A dictionary in Python is a collection of data stored in key-value pairs. Dictionaries are written using curly braces {}, with keys and values separated by a colon :.

2.Each key must be unique, while values can be of any data type.

3.Key Characteristics of Dictionary

4.Stores data in key-value format

5.Keys must be unique and immutable

6.Values can be of any data type

7.Mutable (values can be changed)

8.Does not support indexing

ALGORITHMS

Algorithm 1: Creation and Display of Dictionary

1.Create a dictionary with keys such as Brand, Model, and Year.

2.Print the dictionary.

3.Algorithm 2: Accessing Values Using Keys

4.Create a dictionary with car details.

5.Access the value using its key.

6.Display the value.

Algorithm 3: Duplicate Keys Handling in Dictionary

1.Create a dictionary with duplicate keys.

2.Assign different values to the same key.

3.Print the dictionary.

4.Observe that the latest value overwrites the previous one.

Algorithm 4: Finding Length and Type of Dictionary

1.Create a dictionary.

2.Use len() to count key-value pairs.

3.Use type() to check the data type.

Algorithm 5: Adding and Updating Dictionary Elements

1.Create a dictionary with car details.

2.Use the update() method to add a new key-value pair.

3.Display the updated dictionary.

4.Use the values() method to retrieve all values.

Algorithm 6: Retrieving and Removing Dictionary Elements

1.Create a dictionary storing student information.

2.Retrieve a value using a key.

3.Remove a key-value pair using pop().

4.Print the updated dictionary.

Algorithm 7: Updating Product Prices

1.Create a dictionary storing product names and prices.

2.Display the original dictionary.

3.Update the price of a product.

4.Display the updated dictionary.

Algorithm 8: Searching Student Marks

1.Create a dictionary storing student names and marks.

2.Take student name as input.

3.Check if the name exists in the dictionary.

4.Display marks if found, else display an error message.

Algorithm 9: User Login Validation

1.Create a dictionary storing usernames and passwords.

2.Accept username and password from the user.

3.Check if the username exists in the dictionary.

4.Display login success or failure message.

Algorithm 10: Finding Highest Marks

1.Create a dictionary of students and their marks.

2.Use the max() function with the get() method.

3.Display the student with the highest marks.

DEFINATION OF COMMANDS USED

dict: Built-in data type used to store key-value pairs

len(): Returns the number of key-value pairs

type(): Returns the data type of the variable

update(): Adds or updates key-value pairs in a dictionary

values(): Returns all values from the dictionary

pop(): Removes a specified key and returns its value

in: Checks if a key exists in the dictionary

max(): Returns key with maximum value using get()

get(): Retrieves value of specified key

input(): Takes input from the user

print(): Displays output

Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully studied the Dictionary data type in Python and its operations. We learned how to create dictionaries, access and modify values, remove elements, search records, and apply dictionaries to real-world problems such as student databases, product management, and login systems.

Dictionaries provide an efficient and organized way to store and manage data using key-value pairs.
